## Usage
As a user, I am to view create and track daily workouts. I am able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I am also able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I am able to track my distance traveled. I will reach their fitness goals more quickly when I track their workout progress.

The following screenshots demonstrate the functions of the app:
