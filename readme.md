# Workout Tracker
This is a workout tracker. 

## Installation
This web page is deployed on Heroku, so please click the following link for the web app: [Fitness Tracker](https://fittr-trackr.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage
As a user, I am to view create and track daily workouts. I am able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I am also able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I am able to track my distance traveled. I will reach their fitness goals more quickly when I track their workout progress.
